# SMOKE DETECTOR
The purpose of this experiment is to design a smoke detector, which detects smoke in the environment and triggers the alarm. In this experiment the alarm goes off when the smoke detector level reaches 40%.

# BACKGROUND
A smoke detector is an electronic fire-protection device that automatically senses the presence of smoke, as a key indication of fire, and sounds a warning to building occupants. Commercial and industrial smoke detectors issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a buildingâ€™s central fire alarm system. By law all workplaces must have a smoke detection system.
